        "Pioneers have been an integral part of the community. They have contributed to the community with their natural methods of treating diseases, through farming, logging, and working with different tools to make household items. Pioneers health and medicine was very different from present day. Pioneers did not have medicines and treatments that we have today. Have you ever wondered what health difficulties pioneers faced? Well you are going to find out now. Pioneers were farmers, loggers, blacksmith and storekeepers. They were at a higher risk of infections and accidents. The health difficulties the pioneers had were limited medicines and they did not have any doctors or hospitals. Pioneers did not have resources to cure some diseases and salespersons went from village to village to collect and give medicines. Pioneers did not have antibiotics and faced major illnesses or death due to frostbite, food poisoning, smallpox, cholera, and measles. Today, we know germs cause diseases, but the pioneers had different beliefs. One of the pioneer’s beliefs was that bathing would remove natural things that protect them from diseases. They also believed that diseases started from bad “humor”. This means they thought that evil spirits, bad air, or anything negative could get into the body and cause illness. Do you know how health problems are cured in the pioneer time? Now let’s talk about some ways pioneers treated diseases. How pioneers made an impact on peoples health and well being with their natural remedies. The pioneers treated diseases using natural and herbal remedies. Despite of the herbal and natural remedies the pioneers did not have the treatment and medicine to save the child and mother during the birth of the baby. Even natural remedies could not help with broken bones, gun shot wounds, snakebites, and major internal injuries such as appendicitis and tuberculosis, which were common in pioneer days. The medicines the pioneers made were nature-based and some of the concoctions were toxic due to opium, mercury, cocaine, and alcohol. The natural method involves draining the blood and pulling out teeth by the local barber. Have you ever wondered why a barber’s pole is red and white? It is because red and white identifies blood and bandages. They drained the blood by using leeches to suck the infected blood. Does anyone know how to remove a leech? You can remove a leech by putting salt on the leech and they slip of your body. When you are taking out the leech you do not pull them off otherwise the leeches will suck harder. The herbal remedies are made of natural resources such as plants and trees. Examples are sage is used to cure anxiety and depression by smudging on all your senses. Sitka spruce tree leaf tea is used to avoid infections, pitch is a strong healer, devils club is a tree leaf that is used to treat gout and reduces sugar level in the body for diabetic’s patients. Herbs and leaves are crushed and applied to wounds and chest to take out the diseases. The aboriginal people taught the pioneers to treat stiff joints and upset stomach using crushed dandelion roots. Roasting onions and squeezing its juice was used to cure common cold. Rubbing garlic and clove to treat tooth pain. For asthma, drink tar water, seawater and mercury water. Pioneers used ginger, cayenne pepper, vinegar, camphor, rhubarb roots and salt for bruises and sprains. Some of the natural and herbal remedies were sent to the local apothecary so he could create medicines specific to the illness. Does anyone know what is a apothecary? It is a pharmacy. The pioneers treat diseases using healing circles, sweat lodges, pipe ceremony and medicine wheel. The medicine wheel consists of the color’s red, black, yellow and white. Here’s a fun fact about the medicine wheel. The circle influences how the pioneers view the world, pioneers believe that the world goes in a circular fashion life and there is continuous interaction between the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual realities. After, time went by and doctors were sent to Canada to help sick and injured soldiers living in villages. Canada’s first Doctor, Dr. Robert Gifford, arrived in 1627. Doctors treat pioneers at his house or he would go to the patient’s house if patient were too weak to move. The doctors mixed and crushed medicine by themselves. The medicine was given as tea or a paste to spread on the patient’s skin. Often times pioneers were very poor so they paid the doctor with a meal or resources, some examples are eggs and milk. If you compare life today versus pioneer time you will see a big advancement in the medical equipment, technologies and methods of treating diseases. Thank you friends for listening to my presentation and I hope you learnt a lot about pioneer health and medicine.\n",
